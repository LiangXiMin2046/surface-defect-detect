# Implemention of paper
#### Recently I read the paper "*Segmentation-Based Deep-Learning Approach for Surface-Defect Detection*" and tried to achieve the algorithm by tensorflow.After reading the code by Wslsdx ([click here])(https://github.com/Wslsdx/Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Surface-Defect-Detection),I achieved it myself.My testing environment is same as Wslsdx's.You could run the code by follow commands after you download the KolektorSDD dataset
